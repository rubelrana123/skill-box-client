			question: 'What is purpose of react router ?',
			answer: `React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.
    Let us create a simple application to React to understand how the React Router works. The application will contain three components: home component, about a component, and contact component. We will use React Router to navigate between these components.`,

			question: 'Explain What is Useref in react',
			answer: `The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders The useRef hook simply returns an object with a ".current" property which will be the DOM element or value that you plan to use at some point or another within your component. useRef will not cause any re-renders, it is simply an object that holds the DOM or value you've assigned to it.useRef(initialValue) is a built-in React hook that accepts one argument as the initial value and returns a reference (aka ref). A reference is an object having a special property current.`,
